# Project

## Introduction

This project consists of seven algorithms that I have completed or will complete throughout the course.

I have Implemented Project 1 (sorting algorithms) :

1.Mergesort

2.Heapsort

3.Quicksort 

4.Quicksort using 3 Medians

5.Insertion sort

6.Selection sort

7.Bubble sort

### Execution

To execute the programs we simply give the command python filename.py

Once we run the file we need to give any array of any length as input. This program also takes array with duplicate values.

As an output, we get the sorted array along with its length and running time of the algorithm.

**Input** --------> [9,1,6,3,9,0,2] any array of any length

**Output** -------> [0,1,2,3,6,9,9] sorted array

#### Example

python mergesort.py

enter array [9,1,6,3,9,0,2]

length of the array is 7

The array before sorting is [9,1,6,3,9,0,2]

The array after using mergesort is [0,1,2,3,6,9,9]

The running time for this algorithm is 1.43899989128
